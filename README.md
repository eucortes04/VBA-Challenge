# VBA-Challenge


Looking at analyzing yearly performance of stocks 2014-2016

Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs:

*The ticker symbol
*Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year for that stock.
*The percent change from opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year for that stock.
*The total volume of the stock for that stock.

Used conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red (no change Yellow).

Using info pulled above also output the stock with the greatest increase in percent change, greatest decrease in percent change and the greatest total volume.

Included Screenshots of 2014-2016 results along with VBA script in 2 formats
